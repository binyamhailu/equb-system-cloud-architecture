# Digital Equb Platform - System & Cloud Architecture Design

This repository contains the comprehensive system and cloud architecture design for the Digital Equb platform. The platform enables digital rotating savings groups (Equbs) where users can contribute money regularly and take turns receiving payouts.

## üìö Architecture Design Components

The architecture design is divided into five main components:

1. [High-Level System Architecture](./question1/README.md)
   - System components and microservices breakdown
   - Technology stack and infrastructure choices
   - Communication patterns and integration points

2. [Database Design](./question2/README.md)
   - Database schema and relationships
   - Data modeling and storage strategies
   - Indexing and sharding approaches

3. [API Gateway, Services & Security Plan](./question3/API_Gateway_Security_Plan.md)
   - API Gateway configuration and security
   - Service integration and security measures
   - API security and authentication

4. [Transaction & Payout Logic Strategy](./question4/README.md)
   - Transaction flow and atomicity enforcement
   - Payout scheduling and failure recovery
   - Messaging patterns and payment service interaction

5. [Infrastructure, Observability & Monitoring Setup](./question5/Infra-setup/aws-infrastructure-setup.md)
   - Infrastructure setup and configuration
   - Observability and monitoring tools
   - Performance and health monitoring

## üéØ Key Features

- Digital rotating savings groups
- Secure payment processing
- Real-time notifications
- Automated payout management
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Scalable microservices design

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The platform is built using a microservices architecture with the following key characteristics:

- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for cloud deployment with containerization
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for all services
- **Secure**: End-to-end encryption and security best practices
- **Reliable**: High availability and fault tolerance
- **Maintainable**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Java Spring Boot microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Message Broker**: Kafka for event streaming
- **API Gateway**: Kong/AWS API Gateway
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (primary), with multi-cloud support

## üìã Getting Started

Each component's directory contains detailed documentation and specifications. Start with the [High-Level System Architecture](./question1/README.md) for an overview of the system design.

## üîí Security & Compliance

The platform is designed with security and compliance as core principles:
- End-to-end encryption
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## üéÅ Bonus: Additional Features & Considerations

### 1. Multi-Region Deployment
- Active-Active deployment across multiple AWS regions
- Regional data residency compliance
- Cross-region replication for critical data

### 2. Disaster Recovery
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): < 4 hours
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): < 15 minutes
- Automated failover procedures
- Regular DR testing and validation

### 3. Performance Optimization
- CDN integration for static assets
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategies at multiple levels
- Load balancing and auto-scaling

### 4. Monitoring & Observability
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Real-time metrics with Prometheus
- Custom dashboards in Grafana

### 5. Development Workflow
- GitOps-based deployment
- Automated testing pipeline
- Environment parity
- Feature flag management

### 6. Cost Optimization
- Resource auto-scaling
- Spot instance utilization
- Reserved instance planning
- Cost allocation tagging

### 7. Future Scalability
- Support for multiple payment providers
- International expansion readiness
- Multi-language support
- Customizable group rules

# Digital Equb Platform - System & Cloud Architecture Design

This repository contains the comprehensive system and cloud architecture design for the Digital Equb platform. The platform enables digital rotating savings groups (Equbs) where users can contribute money regularly and take turns receiving payouts.

## üìö Architecture Design Components

The architecture design is divided into four main components:

1. [High-Level System Architecture](./question1/README.md)
   - System components and microservices breakdown
   - Technology stack and infrastructure choices
   - Communication patterns and integration points

2. [Database Design](./question2/README.md)
   - Database schema and relationships
   - Data modeling and storage strategies
   - Indexing and sharding approaches

3. [API Design & Integration](./question3/README.md)
   - RESTful API specifications
   - Integration patterns with external services
   - API security and authentication

4. [Security & Compliance](./question4/README.md)
   - Security architecture and controls
   - Compliance requirements and implementations
   - Data protection and privacy measures

## üéØ Key Features

- Digital rotating savings groups
- Secure payment processing
- Real-time notifications
- Automated payout management
- Multi-tenant architecture
- Scalable microservices design

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The platform is built using a microservices architecture with the following key characteristics:

- **Cloud-Native**: Designed for cloud deployment with containerization
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling capabilities for all services
- **Secure**: End-to-end encryption and security best practices
- **Reliable**: High availability and fault tolerance
- **Maintainable**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js/Java Spring Boot microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Message Broker**: Kafka for event streaming
- **API Gateway**: Kong/AWS API Gateway
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (primary), with multi-cloud support

## üìã Getting Started

Each component's directory contains detailed documentation and specifications. Start with the [High-Level System Architecture](./question1/README.md) for an overview of the system design.

## üîí Security & Compliance

The platform is designed with security and compliance as core principles:
- End-to-end encryption
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
